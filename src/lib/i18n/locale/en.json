There is excessive wear and tear of the surfaces of teeth by grinding or overbite issues.

By restoring missing teeth with dental implants or prostheses, patients can avoid complications such as tooth drift, which can lead to further occlusal problems. Additionally, improved occlusal contact and the restoration of the vertical dimension of occlusion can alleviate stress on the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), reducing pain and discomfort. Ultimately, these enhancements lead to a healthier mouth, preventing the progression of dental issues and promoting a better quality of life."
